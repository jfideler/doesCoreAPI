    Lurch Montgomery can bring any product to life through our assembly area. Specializing in labor-intensive technical assembly,
    we are able to manufacture and assemble "one-of-a kind" equipment and products. We work with plastics, metals, elastomers and composites.
    Our capabilities include assembly of electronic components, the mounting of electronic components to circuit boards, mechanical assembly
    and the testing of assembled products to specifications. We will work with you to obtain U.L. approval. Our size gives us flexibility to
    provide for special packaging and shipping needs, assuring a quick turnaround for custom projects.
</p>
<p id="services.mechanical"><strong>Mechanical</strong></p>
<p>
    On the Mechanical side, Lurch Montgomery brings to the table a wide variety of skills and creative thinking developed over
    years of planning, nurturing and completing projects that our customers have dreamed of. We use our "artistic" thinking in providing
    innovative and surprising results for our customers. We make prototype tools in-house and use a modular approach in prototype building,
    which saves our customers money. We also consult with firms or handle the entire project.
</p>
<p id="services.copier"><strong>Copier, Laser, High Speed Printer Rollers</strong></p>
  <p>Lurch Montgomery provides a wide variety of services for our customers who use rollers of varying types in servicing
    electronic data processing, banking, and other equipment. We reverse engineer almost any style of roller to reduce the cost to our
    customer versus the original equipment manufacturer. Specializing in IBM mag rollers (3800, 3900, 4100 series) these rollers are
    often better than the originals. We also provide a rebuilding service to thoroughly refurbish copiers and high-speed laser and
    printer rollers. We work with a variety of coatings and internal components of these high-cost rollers. We do fuser rollers,
    backup rollers, magnetic toner feed rollers, feed, idler and print rollers. Please call us to help you with your roller needs.
</p>
<p id="services.rubber"><strong>Silicone and Rubber Molding</strong></p>
    <p>
    At Lurch Montgomery, we will take on your silicone and rubber specialty molding projects. We do precision work for
    medical, military, and industrial customers using state of the art materials including fluoropolymers. We also have developed a
    process to bond silicone to Teflon products such as DuPont Viton, as well as low-cost problem solving projects for lower tech products.
    We work directly with custom blenders of materials, as well as using off the shelf materials. You specify your products requirements,
    and we will select a material to fit your needs. We have taken on projects that other molding companies have turned down because of
    lack of volume, or their inability to make a product to the customerâs needs. We pride ourselves in having the expertise to make your
    product the way you need it.<br/>
    </p>
<p id="services.schematics"><strong>Schematics</strong></p>
<p>A schematic diagram can be reverse engineered for circuitry currently undocumented or inadequately documented. Beginning with a visual inspection,
    we determine cost and approximate length of time to complete the drawing. Any technical information or data available will favorably
    influence both cost and lead-time. Using Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), we are able to re-engineer accurate,
    well laid out schematics for whole units, including power supplies, circuit boards and displays.
</p>
<p id="services.reverse"><strong>Reverse Engineering</strong></p>
<p>
    Worn out or broken parts are often too expensive to replace, or are no longer available. A re-engineered part can actually cost less to
    manufacture than the original part and results in a more reliable, less expensive unit to maintain. All we need to start is a sample.
    A comprehensive evaluation is performed, determining material and labor required to complete the project. We carefully consider the options
    to determine which part or tool is best suited for your product.
</p>
<p>
    Next, a drawing is generated and used in the design and fabrication of a prototype. The prototype is then tested, establishing a model
    for production.

<p id="products.pvd"></p><h1>Pressure Vapor Deposition (PVD)</h1><p></p>
<p>
    <img src="app/content/images/i_home.jpg" alt="pvd" title="pvd" style="float:right; margin:0 0 12px 18px;"/>
    We all know machines and their parts wear. More and more processes are brought to their knees by outages caused by wear of individual components. Wear protection is becoming increasingly important to keep production running and maintenance costs to a minimum. Thin layer, multilayer coatings have proved themselves in all applications.
    What we know that these coatings – PVD (Pressure Vapor Deposition) coatings:
    
    </p><ul>
        <li>extremely hard</li>
        <li>self harden to provide sliding protection</li>
        <li>increase tool and component life</li>
        <li>decrease pressures used in production</li>
        <li>they lower machine operating temperatures</li>
    </ul>

<p>
    These coatings are extremely thin and do not alter the dimensions of the part as they become part of the crystalline structure of the base material.
    They also add a cosmetic plus to the parts, which when worn away tells the operator it is time to take the tool or part out for recoating.
    The PVD process is environmentally clean and will not change the properties of the substrate.
    We use the evaporation by arc process. In this process the material being deposited is evaporated by striking an arc on its surface whereby the vapor particles are accelerated towards the component being coated and drawn to it via a bias current supplied to the component. High energy levels create a plasma cloud allowing the particles to penetrate into the grains of the substrate metal.

    Arc running on a cathode.

    TiAlN
    Titanium Aluminum. Adding aluminum to the TiN mix increases hardness and oxidation stability of the coating, resulting in longer tool life especially cutting tools running at high speed.
    CrN
    Chromium Nitride has a lowstress structure which allows for thicker coatings which gives it better corrosion resistance than standard TiN. This coating is over twice as hard as standard hard chrome plating, self hardens and allows parts to slide freely on one another.
    TiCN
    Titanium Carbo Nitride give longer tool life, higher cutting speeds, have good adhesion and low coefficient of friction
    These are some of the standard coatings we apply. We have several proprietary multi layer coatings that have increased tool life up to 8 times over standard coatings. We would like to hear from you to discuss any special requirement you may have.
